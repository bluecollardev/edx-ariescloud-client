## Verified Organizations Network (VON) Quick-start Demo

#### About VON

The goal of the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) project is to explore the design of an open, unified and trusted network of organizational data for use by people and services across British Columbia. The network can reduce the effort put forward by people looking to use services requiring data about their organization since it is readily available from trusted sources.

VON offers government digital service providers the possibility of dramatically improving their users' service experience. This is accomplished through open and simple access to authenticated organizational data so their users don't need to find and re-enter data the government already holds. Data is simply shared when its open, or shared with authorized consent.
